## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was having some problems positioning the main image in the grid layout, and found out the problem was that I was targeting the img tag, and not the picture one. Once I changed that, it worked as intended.
